# sequences_LCRN

Code for a neural network that generates sequential activity - a Locally Connected Random Network (LCRN) with Spatially Correlated Asymmetry (SCA)
Using the simulation software NEST


new_sim_scripts = code for simulating the network (different models and combinations)

new_plot_scripts = code for reading the output of simulation in different way (eg Raster plots, Animations of activity, finding feedforward networks in the Adjacency matrix, find spatial localizations of activity, etc)
